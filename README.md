# NQueensProblem
I solve NQueens Problem using SimpleAI Library on Python. 

NQueens Problem: The n-queens problem is to place n queens (where n > 0) on an n -by-n chessboard so that no queen is threatened by another one. According to the rules of chess, this is equivalent to the requirement that no two queens be on the same row or the same column or on a common diagonal.
